# Brick-Breaker
BRICK-BREAKER is a classic game developed using Java Swing. The player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks arranged at the top of the screen. 
The objective is to clear all the bricks without letting the ball fall. The game includes basic collision detection, scoring, and level progression.
This project was built using Java and the Swing GUI toolkit to practice object-oriented programming and game development fundamentals.
It demonstrates concepts like event handling, timers, graphics rendering, and real-time user interaction.
